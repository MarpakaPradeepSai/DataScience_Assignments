Good Mobile (If you have budget go for it. don't buy to impress or on EMI (not worth it))","As I was aware that what I need and what I was paying for, I needed a quality mobile with best hardware and software combination.I need the OS to be clean without any bloatware which I got.I don't play games. For moderate use of Social media, whatsapp, youtube, audible (audio books), music while exercising, Battery life is around 2 days or sometimes more than 2 days. If you are a gamer or use mobile a lot you might need to charge your mobile everyday.Camera is good. So far the pictures I took the quality is good.Not explore the processor's capacity yet but Never hanged or never will for me (not a heavy user so won't be a problem)."

Amazing Lightning fast phone",The phone is really good it had some overheating issue as heard but not faced any it was due to software update now it is all fixed I still did not had any issue regarding overheating. The phone is really fast and the battery life is awesome. The new action button is really handy and useful. The camera is the best camera an iPhone ever had the photos are stunning and spectacular‚Ä¶. I am satisfied with the phone..

Incremental Upgrade with Enhanced Camera","I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling."

A nice phone","We have received the iPhone 15 Pro Max, natural titanium color, and 256 GB storage capacity. The phone is good-looking and fast. It gets charged with the Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter  (purchased separately). It also charges well using my 3-year-old Mi wireless charger (Qi charging). Overall, we are happy with the iPhone."

Worth every penny, awesome battery life","If you already have 14 Pro or Pro Max then don't upgrade, but if you've any other Pro or non Pro models go for it. If you need an iPhone with 24-26hr battery life on a single charge then go for Pro Max models. No doubt Apple's 4K 60fps ProRes is really awesome, and the all new type-c port is the best thing Apple has done in years. Also all the type-c cables included in the box are woven design, now expecting this will not turn grey after few months of use."

Beast Gadget with PROS CONS","Pros :Light weighted ~ My XR weighted more than pro max. It is lighter.Good performance ~ Very smoothGood battery life ~ I charged it 100% at 3 PM now after lazy use it is at 61% at 10.30 PM and Next day till 3.33 PM it is at 18%, which is quite good.Also 5G works good, in my XR there were hardly any networks but it‚Äôs antenna is really good. 5G works like a charm.Cons :Heating was there in 16.0.x but fixed in 17.0.1, in 16.0.x it heats up around cam area at the top mainly.Now after the fix,It heated up in 30-40% charging, then heated up again in 70%, at 80% it is cool, and at 100% it was cool. Which is normal, trust me all iPhones heats up, even my XR heats up but is not observable because of the phone cover.Battery took around 2 hours to charge(my battery was at 6% I put up on charging around 1 PM and at 2.45 or 3 PM it was around 100% now I have set the limit to 80% for good battery life)Later at around 100% battery when I used basic app, it heats up a little around cam area but the heat is very minor. Since I am not using any cover so I felt it.Overall after the fix, the heating is resolved completely, so you can be assured in this area.Battery backup is quite good, I am using 80% optimised battery option and y‚Äôday night I charged it and today till 8.26 PM it is at 27%, I watched video, shopping apps, social media apps heavily.It keeps a check of your battery charging cycle, since I‚Äôm using 80% Limit, the charging has fasten up, it usually takes 35-40 min for 80% and then after it slows down the charging.Durability : I have checked few reviews, the back panel is weak it has high chances of breaking, the front glass is strong but could get scratches.USE COVERS AND TEMPERED. Overall for apple users, it is a beast in performance. Do not panic if this gets heats up, it is an APP and OS issue.I‚Äôm observing the apps and OS and the heating area but it is doing brilliant so far.Cam Quality : I am not liking the front camera pictures, it actually overdo the image, you might not like Selfies but there are plenty of options for video and camera. You can shoot in 4K and Raw max, etc.I‚Äôm not a selfie lover so it is kinda okay for me but you will def not like the after camera processing selfie image.Sound Quality: The best, superior DOLBY sound quality. I haven‚Äôt heard this much of brilliant sound in any of the devices in recent times. Decent sound..!! You will love the music and AV.FYI : It fell down from a meter height but since I had a good case so nothing happened luckily. pls make sure you have a good cover. I saw videos the back panel is weak due to different assembly in this series.PS : I‚Äôm not a heavy user. I don't play games, so cannot review on the heat and battery while playing games."
